I had fun doing the assignment, hope you will like it's execution.
Steps before running our program:


1) First in order to use Gitlab:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>" 	## to create a public ssh key
	cat id_rsa.pub 						## copy this command's output and put it in your gitlab account

2) Create a private token via your gitlab account as it's needed to activate our program( So is the gitlab url you want to use)

3) Install the packages in our requirements.txt file as they are needed for our program
